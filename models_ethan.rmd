## Hierchial Cluster on Data through first step 

Here I'm looking at who did not make it to the background check step. The first thing I did was remove everyone who did pass and got rid of the remaining columns. 

```{r small_clust}

sm_clust <- df %>% filter(is.na(da_mvr_bgc_start)) %>% select(age:da_profile_submit)

```
